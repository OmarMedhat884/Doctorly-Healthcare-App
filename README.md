Project Work Plan â€“ Medical Application & Website (UI/UX)

1. Research & Problem Definition

Conduct an analysis of the healthcare sector and current platforms (e.g., Vezeeta).

Identify user requirements such as appointment scheduling, physician search, medical records management, and telemedicine services.

Articulate the problem statement and establish clear project goals.

2. Requirement Gathering

Compile and document the necessary features (e.g., doctor appointment system, search filters, patient records management, pharmacy delivery services).

Categorize requirements into essential features (must-have) and supplementary features (nice-to-have).

3. User Persona & Journey Mapping

Create user personas (e.g., patients, healthcare providers, pharmacy customers).

Outline user journeys to illustrate interactions such as scheduling appointments, consulting with doctors, or ordering medications.

4. Wireframing

Develop low-fidelity wireframes for the application and website interfaces.

Concentrate on user flow, navigation framework, and content arrangement.

5. UI Design (High-Fidelity)

Establish a cohesive style guide (colors, typography, icons, medical-themed aesthetics).

Create high-fidelity mockups for all application and website pages.

6. Prototyping

Construct an interactive prototype using Figma to emulate key processes (e.g., booking a physician, video consultation, ordering medications).

Ensure the prototype accommodates both mobile and desktop user interactions.

7. Testing & Feedback

Perform usability testing with colleagues or prospective users.

Gather feedback regarding navigation, booking convenience, and overall user experience.

Enhance the design to boost usability and accessibility.

8. Final Presentation & Documentation

Prepare a polished final presentation (slides and Behance case study).

Provide the interactive prototype along with comprehensive documentation (personas, journey maps, wireframes, design system).
